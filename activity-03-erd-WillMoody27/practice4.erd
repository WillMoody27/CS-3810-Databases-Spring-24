- a company sells different types of productsâ€‹;

Attr Products:

- each product has an unique number, a description, and a sell priceâ€‹; ðŸ”¥

- customers can buy products by placing ordersâ€‹;

Attr Orders:

- an order has an unique number, a shipping address, and a customer nameâ€‹;

- an order is associated with one or more items, each of them based on a specific product and the quantity bought by the customerâ€‹;
- items in an order are uniquely identified by a sequential number.

    // Can a order exits without a customer? No, so it is mandatory

}

// For unique identifier we use the key attribute represented by the key keyword "key" in the entity definition. 
// - The key attribute is the unique identifier for the entity.
