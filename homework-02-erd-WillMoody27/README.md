# TODO #1 (2 points)

Design an E/R model using crow's foot notation for a gym where customers are uniquely identified by email, having other attributes such as name, date of birth, weight and height. Every time a client enters or leaves the gym they need to swipe their personal card to release an access turnstile, which generates a record in the system.

- a course has a number (unique) and a title
- each student has a unique ID and name
- a course can have multiple students
