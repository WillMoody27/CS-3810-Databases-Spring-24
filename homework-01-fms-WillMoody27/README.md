# Instructions

In class we discussed File Management Systems (FMS) which rely on files and folders to maintain data records. In this assignment you are asked to finish an implementation of a simple FMS to manage projects for a small-size company. A project has a title, start and end dates, and an estimated budget. Employees in the company are associated to one (an only one) project at a time. Also, each employee has an unique id, a name and works in a department. All data records should be stored in the "db" folder.
