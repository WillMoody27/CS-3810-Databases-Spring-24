The organizers of an international conference need to keep track of a large collection of workshops associated with the event (Entity). Initial requirement analysis brings out the following information about what needs to be recorded.

<!--  -->

- Each workshop has a name and happens on a particular date or dates (some workshops last more than one day).

- There are several participants, each of which may sign up to one or more Workshops.

- There are a number of meeting rooms at the conference venue, each of them with a fixed capacity. Meeting rooms are identified by a floor and a room number.

- Each workshop needs to be allocated to a meeting room; if a workshop lasts for more than one day, it will use the same room on all days.

Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using crow's foot notation suitable for representing the information described above, including the connections between participants, workshops, rooms, and dates. You should add appropriate attributes for each entity set or relationship, identifying key attributes, weak entity sets/relationship, and partial keys when applicable.
