# Practice #1

Draw an E/R Diagram using crow's foot notation to represent:​

* employees work at one department at a time, while a department can (potentially) have many employees​;
* a department might exist without an employee working at it;
* an employee might exist without working at a department;
* employees can have family members listed as dependents (for health benefits)​; 
* each dependent is associated with only employee; 
* an employee might not have dependents; 
* a dependent cannot exist without being associated with an employee.
