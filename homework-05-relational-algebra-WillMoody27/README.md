Consider the following:

- \*service code is just a number;
- service labor describes how many hours is projected for the service;
- parts is the cost of all parts used to service a particular vehicle.

# Part 1 (3 points)

Create a relational model from the ER one, making sure that all relations are properly identify, with primary keys and domains.

# Relational Model ðŸ”¥

```
Vehicles(plate_number*: String, owner: String, phone: String, email: String)
Services(code*: int, description: String, labor: int)
Serviced(plate_number*: String, services_code*: int, date: Date, parts: float)
```

# Part 2 (2 points) ðŸ”¥

Using **relational algebra**, create a relation with a complete description of all the services done on the vehicle identified by plate number 'DBMS-3810' on February 15, 2024.
